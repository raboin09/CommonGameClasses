/**
 * Defines various types of hit reactions and knockback effects in response to impacts.

 * This enumeration is used to classify the intensity and type of reactions triggered by

 * different responses, such as knockback or specific hit animations, based on the
 * gameplay context.
 *
 * Available reaction types:
 * - None: No reaction is applied.
 * - Knockback_Tiny, Knockback_VeryLight, Knockback_Light, Knockback_Medium, etc.:
 *   Represent varying levels of knockback intensity, ranging from slight displacements
 *   to severe impacts.
 * - HitReact_Light: Specifies a light hit reaction usually tied to animations or minor effects.
 * - HitReact_Special1: Denotes a custom or specialized hit reaction distinct from standard reactions.
